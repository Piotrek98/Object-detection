Create your own haar classifier. Go to this repository (https://github.com/mrnugget/opencv-haar-classifier-training) and do what they wrote there.

Do you need a big database of positive and negative images? It's nothing problem.

1.Record a short film of object what you need detected, only 10-15 second.
2.Record a long film without your object. We want only background. This film should have 2-3 minutes because we need a big database of negative images.
3.In my repository, you find program which save every frame of film as a image. Change path in code source and run. Remember, do it in folder.
