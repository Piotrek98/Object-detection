Create your own haar classifier. Go to this [repository](https://github.com/mrnugget/opencv-haar-classifier-training) and do what they wrote there.

Do you need a big database of positive and negative images? 
It's nothing problem.

  1. Record a short film of object what you need detected, only 10-15 second.
  2. Record a long film without your object. We want only background. This film should have 2-3 minutes because we need a big database of negative images.
  3. In my repository, you find a program(save_image.py) which save every frame of film as a image. Change path in code source and run. Remember, do it in folder.
